# What is it?
My project is an extension of the web version of WhatsApp that allows users to run the script through the built in mac app called automator. This makes it so users dont have to run the script in their IDE to use the program. Once users have the program booted it up it asks for two fields to be entered, one being the phone number which is checked with regex to make sure it follows proper US numbers and a text messsage field which is also checked to make sure that their is message that is greater than or equal to one character. There is also a clear all fields button that removes all text from the entry windows and removes the borders of red or green that come along with entering invalid or valid numbers and messages. There is also sounds that play when an erorr box is shown and a sending message sound effect that plays when the user hit the send button. After hitting send the program automatically opens whatsApp on the web where the message is already typed out and after a short time of waiting the message will send.

# Why did I make it?
While the use of this program is obviously not practical as you can just use the web version of WhatsApp from the start, I created this as a first project in python that allowed me to teach myself a lot about the language and is libraries. I learned how to create and design tkinter windows, utilize python libraries, use regex, and control/automate parts of my computer through another. Taking what I learned during this project will surely benefit me in the future as I go on to create more python projects with better capabilties and designs than this one and also help me apply this to other languages such as HTML or JavaScript.

# What do I want to add?
If time permitted for this project I would hope to add some more features. One key thing I wanted to add but was unable to figure out in the amount of time given was the ability to send pictures with my text messages. I spent quite a bit of time working on this idea but adding it to my final project would require me reworking a great deal of my project something that I am not comfortable doing as the deadline nears. Some other things I think about adding to the project are features such as automatic window resizing as the text entry grows to big, or allowing multiple users to be sent messages, and finally adding drop down menus for predetermined contacts and or messages to be sent.
