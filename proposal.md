# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
GUI for Automating WhatsApp Messages

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A tkinter GUI that allows users to input the number they wish to send a message to, in addition to the time they want it to send.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allow users when they run the code to input the message and nummber they want to send using PyWhatKit, A python library that allows python to access WhatsApp. Some of the features as previsuoly noted are timing messages to be sent,inputting phone numbers and inputting messages all within a custom built Tkinter GUI.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-program that allows users to input the recipients number
-program that allows users to input the message they wish to send
-program that allows users to select the time the message will send

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-program that allows users to input the recipients number in the GUI
-program that allows users to input the message they wish to send in the GUI
-program that allows users to select the time the message will send in the GUI

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-program that allows users to input the recipients number in a well designed GUI
-program that allows users to input the message they wish to send in a well designed GUI
-program that allows users to select the time the message will send in a well designed GUI
-progam that allows users to attach files and or images to the message they send
-program can be accessed by users from anywhere such as anyone with access to the code

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps I will have to take for this project are as follows. I will need to understand the python library that I choose to install for this project and all its capabilties. I will also have to focus on how to create a well designed GUI that is easy for the user to understand. I will also need to understand how features such as time work within python and apply that to my software. All of this will come with research and practice with these systems.
