#### Project title

WhatsApp Messenger GUI

#### What have you done for your project so far?

For this project so far I have added the user interface using Tkinter and the library PyWhatKit. Within, that interface I allowed users to add the phone number they wish to send the message to and checked to make sure it follows the correct number format using regex. I also allow users to input a message they wish to send to the written number. I also took the time to create an app icon that skips over the process of having to run the code through my IDE, making it feel more like an application or extension of WhatsApp.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

At this point in time the only problem I have encountered is adding a way for users to attach an image to send along with their text. This is a feature included in PyWhatKit but it is done through the file directory system and not attaching a file. I plan to implement this through an extension of a Tkinter library as long as time permits.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Some problems I have encountered over the course of this project is correctly doing the interface through Tkinter with just some little syntax errors. I also had problems with the PyWhatKit and sending the messages in a timely manner and fixing all sorts of errors and making things run better.
